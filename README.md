## Description
You are a nuclear scientist working on the ENTROPY ENGINE - a revolutionary new reactor that can generate limitless energy for humanity. The only catch is, itâ€™s unstable. Given enough time, the radioactive particles emitted by this engine will eat through the walls of the reactor.

Using your arrow keys, control the gravity within the reactor by matching the colored particles to the same colored control blocks. Be careful though, as two like colored particles will cancel each other out!

#### Instructions:
- Use the arrow keys to control gravity.
- Match colored particles to the receiver blocks (marked with +).
- Level objectives are marked on the upper right corner.
- Like colored balls will cancel each other out and may lead to inability to stop the reaction.
